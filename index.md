### Gamedev

{{layout.lod1}}
Just for fun & knowledge <abbr title="reverse engineering">reversing</abbr> favorite cool old games (before 2000) and making remakes - crossplatform rebirth. _Mostly for private usage._

{{layout.lod1}}
First of all, in the past developers put their hearts to the old games and treated them as an object of art.
In these games there is always a story, humor, they are fun, interesting and surprising and honest with the player, unlike most modern profit-centered games. Such games must teach our children!

{{layout.lod1}}
Secondly, the old games inside is a storehouse of information.
Earlier there were not so much computational resources and people worked more carefully with memory and graphics. The reversing of the old games teaches a lot and this is madly interesting!
